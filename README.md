**!!PLEASE MAKE SURE SOUND IS ON WHEN PLAYING!!**

#### **Design Hypothesis**<br>
What makes a game scary? Is it horror elements such as jump scares, loud noises and the supernatural? I do not believe this is the case. What makes a game scary is its ability to instil fear in the player, but how can you make a game do that? One way is by using horror elements, but I believe that a game is most scary when you don't expect that you are playing a horror game. For this prototype, I want to attempt to instil fear into players without the use of horror cliches and by having them think it is not a scary game when they first boot it up. Can this be done? Can the psychological horror genre be achieved with minimal effort? That is what I am here to find out.
