### !!PLEASE MAKE SURE SOUND IS ON WHEN PLAYING!!

### **Design Hypothesis**<br>
What makes a game scary? Is it horror elements such as jump scares, loud noises and the supernatural? I do not believe this is the case. What makes a game scary is its ability to instil fear in the player, but how can you make a game do that? One way is by using horror elements, but I believe that a game is most scary when you don't expect that you are playing a horror game. For this prototype, I want to attempt to instil fear into players without the use of horror cliches and by having them think it is not a scary game when they first boot it up. Can this be done? Can the psychological horror genre be achieved with minimal effort? That is what I am here to find out.

### **Feedback & Reflection**<br>
For my second prototype, I attempted a horror game. I decided to solely focus on creating a scary environment without relying on horror cliches. I decided to use this prototype as an opportunity to test how far I could go to create horror without cliche methods. Thanks to the playtesters, I was able to see whether or not I was successful at accomplishing my goal and how I could further improve it. Here is what I learned from my playtesters.

**Atmosphere**<br>
Right away, the playtesters were able to guess that they were playing a horror game due to the atmosphere at the start of the game. The atmosphere was eery, dark, silent and empty, which led them to that conclusion. Thanks to this feedback, I now know how I can mislead the players into thinking they aren't playing a horror game so that they are unaware, which makes them more likely to get scared because that is the main goal when making a scary game.

**Controls/Gameplay**<br>
The first-person and flashlight mechanic also led players to believe they were playing a horror game (mainly the flashlight). Perhaps, I could set up a different scenario, at first, where the player doesn't have the flashlight yet. Additionally, the game controls had a couple of issues. First, the first-person camera was stuttery for most playtesters, and secondly, the flashlight was a bit too bright for their taste. The high brightness and dark environment gave an uneasy contrast that wasn't pleasant to the player's eyes. I plan on adjusting these issues in future iterations of this prototype by fixing the camera and the brightness of the flashlight. Playtesters also wished there was more gameplay mechanics than just the flashlight, so I will try to give more interactivity to the player and perhaps incorporate it with the flashlight.

**Sound Effects (SFX)**<br>
In my prototype, I added sound effects to add some realism. The sound effects were quiet, and it made players feel uneasy. I intended on making the sounds quiet because, as I mentioned previously, I didn't want to resort to horror cliches such as loud noises to scare players. However, there's a case where the footstep sound effects wouldn't trigger at all when you're going down the stairs. It is a minor issue, but it still needs to be fixed.

**Level Design**<br>
For this prototype, I designed the level to look like a house. With minimal design effort, I was able to give the playtesters a sense of where the game takes place. Although they knew the level design is a house, they wished it would resemble more like one with some furnishing, materials and assets. If I were to continue adding to this prototype, I would most definitely polish the level design with the help of assets.

**The Ending**<br>
At first, I was afraid that the ending was anti-climatic and would leave players to go: "That was it?" because they didn't end up encountering any jumpscares when they were expecting some. Thankfully, that wasn't the case in my prototype. The playtesters enjoyed the ending, and it even gave them a scare. It just left them wanting more.

**Conclusion**<br>
There are plenty of issues to fix in my prototype, but it is also brimming with possibilities. I could add more rooms, a larger/more detailed environment, more mechanics and a fleshed-out story with more goals than just going from point A to B. Of course, if I do add more, I will make sure they are tailored to fit the horror game genre.

**Improvements**<br>
* Change the start of the game's atmosphere to mislead players
* More detailed level environment (add assets, materials, shaders, etc.)
* Fix first-person camera and sound effect issues
* Refine the narrative
* Add more mechanics (more interactivity)
